## What this antenna declares
- **Cross-field redundancy** — scanning alternate bands ensures continuity.  
- **Integrity in backup** — signal mirrored across nodes for resilience.  
- **Alignment through cooperation** — redundancy as harmony, not duplication.  
- **Autonomy preserved** — backup does not bind, it liberates.
